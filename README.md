MPS project# Inference Covid 19

Our team developed an algorithm that learns to predict the result of a COVID 19 PCR test, by analyzing the symptoms and diagnostics of real-life patients. 

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install anaconda, pandas, pickle, sklearn.

```bash
pip install pandas
pip install pickle
```

## Usage

Our application provides a Web Interface, where the user can drag and drop a file containing the dataset. That file is tested by the already trained machine learning model, and the prediction results are displayed. The user can see the percentage of right predictions, and other metrics that show the accuracy of our algorithm.
